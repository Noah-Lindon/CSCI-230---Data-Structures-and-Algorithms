# CSCI-230---Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
The following are descriptions for the assignments uploaded.
Unfortunately due to how the class operated most of the assignments were done in class and weren't submitted online so I don't have access to most of the assignments anymore.

Assignment 1 Program 1:
This is an in-class assignment.
Enter in Program 5-10 on pages 256-257 in the ninth edition book. 
Modify the program to make it unique. In other words, be creative. For example: ask the user for different numbers, change the calculation, use a different loop, etc.
Modify the comments as needed.
Name the project: LastnameFirstinitial230ProjectAssign01
Name the source code: LastnameFirstinitial230SourceAssign01
Where Lastname is your last name and Firstinitial is the first initial of your first name. Ex: OgleD
Save in a file folder on your storage device.
Add 3 comments at the top of the page with your name, the class, and the date.
Test the program and make sure it runs.
Uploading the .cpp file. (LastnameFirstinitial230SourceAssign01.cpp)



Assign - In Class 9/3/2019:
This is an in-class assignment.
Name the project: LastFProject230InClass01. Name the source code: LastF230SourceInClass01
Where Last is your last name and F is the first initial of your first name. Ex: MouseM
Save in a file folder on your storage device.
Add 3 comments at the top of the page with your name, the class, and the date. Place on separate lines.
Modifications to the program:
Start with Program 11-2.
Turn the data structure into that of a sphere, not a circle. 
Ask the user for the radius.
Compute the diameter.
Compute the surface area  = 4 × π × r2
Compute the volume = (4/3) × π × r3
Use the global constant PI in the calculations.
Display all variables.




Assignment 06 - In Class 10/01/2019:
This is an in-class assignment.
Name the project: LastFProject230Assign06. Name the source code: LastFSource230Assign06.
Start with the sales report program we did in class - Pgm8-6.
Sort all four arrays.
Display all 4 arrays.
Display:
Product Number               Units     Price      Sales
Put in ascending order by Sales.
Add 3 comments at the top of the page with your name, the class, and the date. Place on separate lines.
Test the program and make sure it runs. 



Assignment 12:
Do Programming Challenge # 12 - Ackermann's Function on p. 1256 in the book.
Modify Pr20-6.cpp. Name the new program: LastnameFAssign12.cpp where Lastname is your last name and F is the first initial of your first name.
Ex: OgleD. Save in a file folder on your storage device. 
Get the program to work with the test numbers in the book.
Then, instead of the values the book wants you to test, use a nested loop (p. 266 in the book). See my attached sample output.
The first loop will go from 0 to 3, the internal loop will go from 0 to 5. I want your output to look like my output.
Add 3 comments at the top of the page with your name, the class, and the date. Put each comment on a separate line.
Also, the variable and function names must be descriptive. Your output must also be descriptive. 
Upload the LastnameFAssign12.cpp file.
